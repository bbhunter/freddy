/***********************************************************
 * Freddy the serial(isation) killer.
 ***********************************************************
 * Burp Suite extension based on the work of Alvaro Muñoz
 * (@pwntester) and Oleksandr Mirosh which they presented
 * at Black Hat USA 2017 and Def Con 25.
 *  - https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/briefings.html#friday-the-13th-json-attacks
 *
 * Alvaro and Oleksandr looked at various JSON and XML
 * serialization libraries and found that many of them can
 * be abused to execute deserialization/object injection
 * attacks in the same way as native serialization APIs
 * such as those found in Java and PHP.
 *
 * Further payloads and targets were implemented in
 * version 2.0 based on ysoserial.NET (Alvaro Muñoz) and
 * the paper "Java Unmarshaller Security - Turning your
 * data into code execution" by Moritz Bechler.
 *  - https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/
 *  - https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true
 *
 * This Burp Suite extension performs active and passive
 * detection of various serialization libraries/APIs.
 ***********************************************************
 * Version Notes
 * 2.0 Revamped release (04/04/2018)
 *  -> Rewrote module architecture to standardise and simplify module
 *     implementation. Majority of scanner module logic is now found in the
 *     FreddyModuleBase class and the modules themselves simply register
 *     indicators and generate payloads.
 *  -> Optimisations have been introduced so that, as much as possible, data is
 *     only generated once and used multiple times. Previously, for example, a
 *     request would be converted from a byte array to a string for every scan
 *     check. Now the Freddy class generates this string once and passes it to
 *     each module for searching.
 *  -> Support for more targets has been added as follows:
 *       BinaryFormatter (.NET native API)
 *       DataContractSerializer (.NET native API)
 *       LosFormatter (.NET native API that uses ObjectStateFormatter under the hood)
 *       NetDataContractSerializer (.NET native API)
 *       ObjectStateFormatter (.NET native API)
 *       SoapFormatter (.NET native API)
 *       XmlSerializer (.NET native API)
 *       BlazeDS AMF 0 (Java 3rd party)
 *       BlazeDS AMF 3 (Java 3rd party)
 *       BlazeDS AMF X (Java 3rd party)
 *       Burlap (Java 3rd party)
 *       Castor (Java 3rd party)
 *       Hessian (Java 3rd party)
 *       JYAML (Java 3rd party)
 *       Kryo (Java 3rd party)
 *       Kryo (Java 3rd party - alternative deserialization strategy)
 *       ObjectInputStream (Java native API)
 *       Red5 AMF 0 (Java 3rd party)
 *       Red5 AMF 3 (Java 3rd party)
 *       Snake YAML (Java 3rd party)
 *       XmlDecoder (Java native API)
 *       XStream (Java 3rd party)
 *       YAMLBeans (Java 3rd party)
 *  -> Support for additional payloads has been added.
 *
 * 1.0 Initial release (23/01/2018)
 *  -> Passively detects the use of the following serialization libraries/APIs
 *     through the JSON/XML type specifier field in a request or exceptions in
 *     responses:
 *       DataContractJsonSerializer (.NET native API)
 *       FastJson (.NET 3rd party)
 *       FSPickler - JSON format (.NET 3rd party)
 *       FSPickler - XML format (.NET 3rd party)
 *       JavascriptSerializer (.NET native APIE)
 *       Json.Net (.NET 3rd party)
 *       Sweet.Jayson (.NET 3rd party)
 *       FlexJson (Java 3rd party)
 *       Genson (Java 3rd party)
 *       Jackson (Java 3rd party)
 *       JSON-IO (Java 3rd party)
 *  -> Actively detects the use of each of the above using error-based
 *     payloads.
 *  -> Where possible, time-based and collaborator-based payloads are also used
 *     for active detection.
 *       DataContractJsonSerializer
 *       FastJson
 *       JavascriptSerializer
 *       Json.Net
 *       Jackson
 *  -> Burp Intruder payload generators for manual testing.
 ***********************************************************
 * Module/Payload status
 * ----------------------
 * .NET payloads
 * --------------
 * All tested and working apart from PSObject payloads which only work against
 * systems not patched for CVE-2017-8565.
 *
 *
 * Java payloads
 * --------------
 * All passive scanner checks and exception-based active scanner checks are
 * tested and working. Various collaborator payloads have not been confirmed
 * working as of version 2.0 (4th April 2018).
 *
 * The following list details the status of each. Tests were performed using a
 * demo web application and failures don't necessarily indicate a problem with
 * Freddy but instead may be the result of the demo app configuration (e.g. JDK
 * version, setup/usage of target library etc). Some payloads may also need to
 * be injected into a property of another object in the serialized data.
 *
